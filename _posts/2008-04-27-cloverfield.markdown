title: Cloverfield (3/5)
---

Cloverfield was an interesting 'bait and switch' movie. The monster isn't the story, it's merely the tool used to bring out the real storyline. The real storyline was about how the relationship between all these people changes. That aspect of the movie was fantastically written, and played out very well. The movie lost stars for being so shaky that it nearly made me motion sick. Seriously, if you watch it on a large screen, get some dramamine. I don't get motion sick, and this was bad.
