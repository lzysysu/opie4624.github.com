On my return from Denver I managed to have a number of new experiences:<br /><ol><li>I won a weather related bet</li><li>I went through the same storm in two different timezones, 12 hours or more apart.</li><li>Feel an airplane drop several thousand feet in a matter of seconds</li> <li>Drove slower than 40mph purely because it was raining so hard I couldn&#39;t see.</li><li>Watched a semi blow through a puddle on the road so deep it threw up a rooster tail that would have rivaled a speedboat.</li><li> Saw a lightning bolt strike a tree under 30ft away as I drove past.</li></ol>It was also pretty fitting that at random I decided to listen to Chemical Brothers Dig Your Own Hole album on the drive.
