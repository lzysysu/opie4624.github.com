<p>After quite a long time of PHP crapping out, I finally decided to ferret out the issue.&nbsp; It turns out the newer versions of chyrp want some extra libraries compiled into PHP.&nbsp; Since my old hosting provider was in control of their PHP implementation, I decided to move the site over to my colo'd box that's been sitting around doing nothing.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; I compiled PHP the way I wanted it, and everything's good.&nbsp; So welcome back!</p>
