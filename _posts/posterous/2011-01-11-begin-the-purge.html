<p></p><p>Tonight I decided it was better late than never to start the grand purge of accumulated detritus in my life and home. I started small, focusing on my desk. I think it took about an hour or so of sorting just to file away all my receipts and get them sent off the <a href="http://www.shoeboxed.com">Shoeboxed</a>. Next was filing and scanning for another hour. I have to tip my hat to the fine folks at <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> for essentially giving me a hole into which I can dump endless amounts of information while still being assured I&#39;ll be able to find it again. As a result of this labor, I now have the nice workspace I should have had. An antique writing desk with a nice leather surface turns out to be a wonderful working surface for computing as well.<br /></p>
