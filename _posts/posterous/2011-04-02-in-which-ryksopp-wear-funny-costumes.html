<p>It&#39;s funny how something as simple as a change in location can change your access to things.<br /> Monday morning I walked to work listening to Röyksopp Forever. That gave me the idea to build a playlist of songs where a DJ had either sampled or worked with an orchestra. Eventually I ended up listening to albums from Röyksopp and Jon Hopkins all day while I worked.<br /> Imagine my surprise when Dave popped his head into the office inviting me to see both of them live that night.</p>
