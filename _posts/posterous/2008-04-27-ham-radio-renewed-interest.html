One of my friends <a href="http://www2.stevecrow.net/welcome/2008/4/15/ham-license-upgraded-hf-station-on-the-air.html">recently upgraded his HAM license</a> and has inspired me to do the same.  I've recently joined the N1SF club at work, and have been trying to get back into the hobby.  Perhaps I'll be able to retire K9OPQ in favor of something shorter! Wish me luck!
