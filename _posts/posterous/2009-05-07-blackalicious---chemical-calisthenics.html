</p><p><br /></p><p>If you asked me what kind of music, I listen to, I would usually respond "Anything but Rap and Country, with exceptions."&nbsp; (I don't include religious music in that list because there are no exceptions there, and it's usually not real music.) Blackalicious is a group that definitely counts as one of those exceptions.<br /></p>
