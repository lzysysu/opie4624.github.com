Last night, my dog got sprayed by a skunk.  We were standing on the driveway when he suddenly saw something across the street.  I thought he was going over to look at the geese in the lake, but instead he had found a baby skunk.  It sprayed him and he came running back smelling like sulfur.  Though it was pretty hilarious seeing him sliding around in the grass on his face trying to get it off.  Anyway, you can check out the youtube I made here: <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jR9_fcCKmeo?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe>
