So, big news everyone! I&#39;m moving to San Francisco. It&#39;s a bit sudden since I&#39;ll be gone by this time next week. Because it&#39;s happening so quick, I know I&#39;m not going to be able to say a proper goodbye or see everyone before I go. However, I will be back soon since I don&#39;t even have time to properly move my stuff. (That&#39;s a promise, not a threat.) I can say that without all the people in this area, it wouldn&#39;t have been nearly as fun and I wouldn&#39;t have stayed this long. I expect visitors, so whenever you feel like making a road trip west, let me know. Hugs!
