<p>Since there were so many people out, there just wasn't room in 140 characters.</p>
<p>Kudos to @the_tiki and @the_magic_elf for being ringleaders of our merry band of social networkers. Also thanks to @bluelineclub for allowing such a churlish group into your fine establishment! Hats off to @DonAtPoundCS, @billmalott, @tamarafoc, @nenairis87, @jmkobus, @dolcedolori, @thejennyli, @mypopquizkid and her "sister" @SpecsAroundTown, and everyone I can't remember.  Conspicuously absent were @BaseCase, @macewank, @dorkimoe, @MasonShow, @RemyRadio, @lina003, @Ashley_Haynes, @lablask, @ScrappinCop and even more.</p>
<p>Also thanks to @the_tiki and @the_magic_elf for the leg-up:</p>
