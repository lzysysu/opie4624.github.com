<p>Today Adam invited me along on his car purchase adventure for moral support and lifting assistance. The adventure started with a stop a Big Pete's House of Munch where Seth Rogen rented us a U-Haul trailer.&nbsp; Then we met up with Crazy Charlie, who told us the ins and outs of the parking lot paint striping business in the process of telling us about the car.&nbsp; After driving back through what appeared to be a town made up entirely of West Bloomington residents, we decided that we had to leave town immediately. A 2 hour drive ended what Adam and I hope is the last trip to Mattoon.</p>
