<pre>
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  I WILL PUNCH CLEARCASE IN THE THROAT
<font colot='#00f'>Andy</font>:   oh yeah?
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  i would if this were Tron, anyway
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  man, things would be so much better
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  when programs made me mad i could just pwn them with my
        electric frisbee
<font colot='#00f'>Andy</font>:   and then drink pure energy straight from the source
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  yes
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  that stuff looks delicious
<font colot='#00f'>Andy</font>:   heheh, yeah it does
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  also, there would be no racism because everyone would be
        grey
<font color='#f00'>Casey</font>:  and you can go from blue to red just by touching someone
