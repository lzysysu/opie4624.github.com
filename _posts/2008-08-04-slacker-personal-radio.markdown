Slacker Personal Radio is an online radio service that learns what you like to listen to. With many stations programmed by DJs, and the capability to create a custom station, there's always something on to listen to. As you favorite (song plays more often) or ban (song never plays again) songs, the new picks become more and more customized. I've found that I'm banning less songs because the radio is playing more that I like. All this works with the free product. Also available is a subscription model which removes the ads from all stations and from the website. With a subscription, every song you've favorited becomes available for on-demand play from the web, software, and portable players.

The radio product can be consumed in a few different ways. The web interface lets you listen to the radio anywhere you have an internet connection. I've been able to listen consistently via my EVDO connection with the same quality that I can via my cable modem.

On Windows machines you can use the Slacker Software Player to listen. The interface looks identical to the web-based product. It allows for CD quality music as well as managing the saved songs on the Slacker Portable.

Lastly, you can purchase a Slacker Portable player. The Portable Player has a Wi-Fi card and USB Port. With a Windows computer, you can synchronize the player via USB. It works equally well over Wi-Fi. In fact, I rarely use the USB port for anything more than the requisite battery charge. I personally think the Portable Player is by far the best feature of the Slacker service. You can find a review of the Portable Player here.

Ultimately, the Slacker Personal Radio service is fantastic. The only time it's failed me is when I don't even know what I want to listen to and for that I can think of no solution.
