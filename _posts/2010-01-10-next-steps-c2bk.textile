Today at the Geekup, I found a bit of direction for my c2bk game project.  I've been trying to write a web-app that will organize and coordinate games of Cruel 2 B Kind.  My plan is also to integrate with TextMarks so that SMS can be used for scoring the games while they're in progress.

I've finished with the data models and I think the next step is the views.  I need to finish scaffolding each model and then work on making things actually accessible from the web.
