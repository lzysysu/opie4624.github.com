<h4>Telephone Technical Support</h4><a href="http://www.ether.com/CallButton/akraut/6532497.aspx"><img src="http://www.ether.com/CallButtonImage/akraut/6532497.aspx?q=2-0" border="0" align="left" /></a> <a href="http://www.ether.com/Mail/Action.aspx?mailId=32910&cd=6FE15nzONHj6GcviVGiqNA%3d%3d"><img src="http://www.ether.com/Mail/ActionImage.aspx" border="0" align="left" /></a> Got a computer question?  With over 2 years of telephone technical support experience in the internet provider realm alone, I am well suited to help with nearly all of the current internet enabled applications.  My further years of consulting and on-site technical assistance experience has prepared me for nearly any technology problem you can throw my way.  My greatest area of expertise is likely my support of Linux systems, coming from personal use and experience for over 7 years.  I offer both telephone and email support.  Telephone support is $60/hr, email is $45/incident.
